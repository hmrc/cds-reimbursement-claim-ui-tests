## Running the tests
    #  Pre-requisites
    Prior to executing the tests ensure you have:
- Docker - to run mongo and browser (Chrome or Firefox) inside a container
  docker run --rm -d --name mongo -d -p 27017:27017 mongo:4.0
- Java (JDK 11 or 21)=Required to compile and run Scala-based projects
  CDSR is mainly compatible with JDK 21
- sbt(Scala Build Tool)=Required to compile & run the application. Ensure the version matches what's in build.sbt
- Git = To clone the repository and manage branches
    1) https://github.com/hmrc/cds-reimbursement-claim-ui-tests
    2) https://github.com/hmrc/cds-reimbursement-claim-frontend
    3) https://github.com/hmrc/cds-reimbursement-claim-stubs

- Appropriate [drivers installed](#installing-local-driver-binaries) - to run tests against locally installed Browser
- Installed/configured [service manager](https://github.com/hmrc/service-manager).

Run the following command to start services locally:

1) To Start all services
   sm2 -start CDSRC_ALL
2) To stop the services
    sm2 --stop-all
3) Checking the status of services (-s or -status)
   sm2 --status

## Running the Tests

Run Acceptance test using SM2 Locally

1. Navigate to the directory where the project has been cloned.
2. To run all acceptance tests on your local machine, use: ```./run_tests.sh```
3. To run all tests that are tagged as "@wip", use: ```./run_tests_wip.sh```
4. By default, the scripts execute in headless mode. To run them with the browser ui visible, set the below-mentioned property in run_tests_wip.sh script - Argument -Dbrowser.option.headless=false

## Security and Accessibility tests
The accessibility and ZAP tests are run as part of Jenkins job. 
We can get the latest reports from the corresponding acceptance-tests CDS Reimbursement Claim UI Tests job.
